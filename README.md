a cluster of classical machine learning problems and codes

1. Cancer Prediction Algorithm 
      Tools: Kaggle Notebook, TensorFlow, GridSearchCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   
      Dataset: Breast Cancer Prediction (1k+ samples, 14 attributes)
      
      - Developed a custom neural network using TensorFlow, achieving 100% accuracy, outperforming baseline models (86%, 94%).
      - Split data into train/test/validation sets (70/15/15) for robust evaluation and implemented feature extraction techniques.
      - Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with histograms, barplots, and swarmplots to visualize patterns.
      - Analyzed feature importance through heatmaps to guide model optimization and feature selection.
      - Applied hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, optimizing RandomForest, ANN, and SVM models.
